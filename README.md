Engineer | Musician | Singer | Social Activist

The raison d'Ãªtre of my life is to be determined towards the software world and its development for the betterment in the standard of living of the society.

Music has been a part my of life since childhood and will be swan song. It has edified me and gifted me a 'Never Give Up!' attitude in life. I have learnt to play several instruments of which I have mastered Keyboard and Guitar. I still stay motivated to achieve a good command on new instruments.

Additionally, I possess a good experience in Python, JAVA, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL.
